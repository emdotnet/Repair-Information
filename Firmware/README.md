## Firmware for Control-Board Microcontrollers
Tormach's control boards use various microcontrollers to handle safety and communication related functions. 

To facilitate repair of boards that have reached end-of-life and are no longer being manufactured, we provide .bin or .hex files here
so that you can replace a broken MCU and reflash it with our firmware. 

Keep in mind, Tormach maintains a stock of replacement boards for our old machines, so if component level replacement and reflashing of MCUs is 
outside of your comfort zone, our technicians at https://tormach.com/support can help you get a replacement board to get your machine up and running.
