## PCB Schematics
Component level schematics of Tormach PCBs are provided here to help you diagnose and test individual components of the boards in your Tormach machine. 

Tormach believes that the products you purchase from us should never become throw away items once the warranty expires. 
Electronic components have a finite lifetime, but if you are comfortable performing the repair, 
replacing individual components on a control board can extend the life of the overall machine. 

These schematics are maintained on a best-effort basis by our engineering team. If there is a document that would help you 
repair a product you own that we have not posted here, please contact our support team at https://tormach.com/support and we 
will do our best to help you.
