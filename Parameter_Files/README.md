These parameter files are intended to allow you to bootstrap a VFD that has had it's EEPROM erased or has been salvaged from another machine.

Flashing the incorrect parameter files to your VFD is possibly the easiest way to render it inopperable. If 
your machine is still under warranty, **please** contact Tormach tech support (https://tormach.com/support) and
we can work on your issue with you. 

If you would prefer to get a programming stick pre-loaded with the correct parameters for your machine from Tormach, the part numbers are as follows:
